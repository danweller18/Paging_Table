This is the README file for my paging table project.

Directions:
	To run this program, open up a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory that contains the file and type java -jar PagingTable.jar. It will ask for a virtual address between -2147483647 and 2147483647. It will return the page number and offset number based on the virtual address that you input. 

What this project does:

	This project imitates a system that has a 32 bit virtual address and a 4KB page size. This program will read in a virtual address in decimal format and output the page number as well as the offset for the virtual address.
